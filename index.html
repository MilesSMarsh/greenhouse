				<h2>Description</h2>
				<p>The project is an endless interactive greenhouse, where the user can click on randomly generated plants to sway the next generation of plants to inherit features from the chosen plant. Each plant is created recursively and according to a structure within its instance. The structure controls certain aspects of the plant such as the length of the stems, the angle of the plants, the number of stems, the color of the plant, and the color of the leaves. Once a plant is chosen, it will appear in the middle of the next generation and certain aspects of the plant are given to the plants on either side of it. This way the plants successively become closer and closer to an ideal plant the user is looking for. On top of the functionality of the program the visuals look great as well with the plants growing from a small sprout when first loading in, to then swaying in the wind as they await a click from the user it all looks great. There are little particles that float around the top of the page further enhancing the experience, and the relative speed of the simulation can be compared between generations of plants by checking how frequently the greenhouse color shifts between green and blue.</p>

				<h2>Technical</h2>
				<p>In our program you can hover your cursor over the plant you wish to keep aspects from and a big red circle will appear indicating the plant you are about to select. Once you select the plant it will grow from the middle and two similar plants will grow beside it. You can choose either of the new plants or click the center plant again to essentially reroll the attributes of the plants on either side. The approach we took was to create a plant recursively focusing on the perceivable features rather than realistic features. We have a limited amount of features to mutate into and a relatively small possibility space. Up to 4 depths, 40 degrees of angle, up to 5 stems, and 40 pixels of length, totaling 32,000 different plants before color. Each RGB color contains 3 values up to 255, meaning that with 2 colors on the plant there are 33162750 different combinations for color. Altogether, we have created a possibility space of 1.061208e+12 different possible plants. Our program creates emergent experiences and uses modular code practices. </p>
